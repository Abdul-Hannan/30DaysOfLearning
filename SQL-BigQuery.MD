# Day 1: Introduction

**1) Understand what SQL is**

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a programming language used to communicate with and manipulate databases. SQL is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e., data incorporating relations among entities and variables.

Take an example of a simple library. You can imagine a "database" as the whole library. A database holds "tables", just as a library has different sections. In each section of this library (i.e., each table in a database), we have books (i.e., the "rows" in the table). Each book has information about it, like the book title, author name, publication year, and so on â€“ these would be the "columns" in our table. 

This is a fundamental understanding of how SQL "communicates" with a database.

**2) Introduction to Google BigQuery**

Google BigQuery is a web service from Google that is utilized for handling and analyzing big data. Its core function is to analyze large datasets, working in conjunction with Google Storage. It's part of the Google Cloud Platform.

You can think of BigQuery as a massive, incredibly fast library (or database) where you can store many books (datasets) and run complex search queries (SQL statements) on them very quickly.

**3) Create a Google Cloud Project**

First, you need to have a Google Account. Once you have that, follow the steps:

- Go to the Google Cloud Console: console.cloud.google.com
- Click on "Select a project" drop-down.
- Click on the "NEW PROJECT" button on the right top.
- Name your project and select your billing account.

You've now created a Google Cloud Project!

**4)  Setup Google BigQuery**

Having created a project in the Google Cloud Console, you can go to BigQuery:

- Go back to the Google Cloud Console dashboard in your project.
- Click on the "Navigation menu" icon in the top left corner.
- Scroll down and find "BigQuery" - click on it.
- Accept terms of service, and you are in BigQuery's interface.

Your SQL journey begins now. This interface you see, where you can input SQL queries and manipulate your data, that's the "BigQuery Editor". 

Day 1 might seem a bit dry, but it's a crucial foundation for what's coming up. For "hands-on", you can play around with the interface to get used to it. You'll soon be running real SQL queries in this very editor. 

Keep going! And remember, everyone starts at the beginning. Hang in there. Tomorrow you'll be writing your first SQL query in the BigQuery Editor!
